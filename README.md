My solutions to [Exercism's Haskell track](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell).

Solutions (/src) are provided along with tests (/test).

Topics covered:

* Language features:
	* Basics (incl. recursion, currying, list comprehensions, maps, folds, algebraic types, higher order functions)
	* Strict vs lazy evaluation
	* Monads and monad transformers
	* Concurrency (atomic operations)
	* Parallelization
	* Lenses
	* Parsec library for parsing

* Algorithms and data structures
	* Functional data structures (stacks, queues, double-ended queues, sets, binary and rose trees, list and tree zippers)
	* Operations on trees: traversing, searching, reparenting, path finding
	* Dynamic programming with memoization
	* Parsing (lots of parsing)
	* Domain-specific language interpretation
	* State machines

Some of my favorite exercises:

* [Implement an evaluator for a very simple subset of Forth](03_Hard/forth)
* [Reparent a graph on a selected node](03_Hard/pov)
* [Given state of a Go game board, list areas taken by each player](03_Hard/go-counting)
